# Online Federated Multitask Learning
This repository is an official implementation of [Online Federated Multitask Learning](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wenjunji/BigData2019Rui.pdf), accepted at BigData 2019.


## Training and Evaluation
run average_error_vs_number_of_device.m, err_ofmtl and time_ofmtl is the corresponding err and time for algorithm ofmtl.

ofmtl.m is the code of algorithm ofmtl

baseline file contains the code for three baselines, including local_svm, global_svm and mocha.

data file contains three dataset we have used.
